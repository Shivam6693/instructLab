## Professional Experience

- IBM, Cloud and Cognitive SoftwareSenior Data Scientist, Build Lab May 2020 - PresentDallas, TX

```
◦Primary responsibilities include leading on 4-10 week partner engagements to build POC (proof-of-concept)/ MVP
(Minimum Viable Product) Data and AI solutions to help partners accelerate their journey to AI
◦Builtanomaly detection modelfor an industry leader in wireless temperature monitoring system to detect the critical
event approximately 84% of the time even in cases they are not obvious
◦Developedrecommendation modelfor a client to automate their product, especially for the expansion to other countries.
Used a novel method to build a Recommendation system using Hamming Distance as vanilla recommendation methods were
not applicable. The recommendation model can suggest the right products 78% of the time
◦BuiltMachine Learning modelfor predicting Covid-19 risk level across US army installations and personnel on IBM
Cloud Pak for Data

- IBM, Global Chief Data OfficeSenior Data Scientist intern June 2018 - Dec 2018Armonk, NY


```
◦Worked on IBM Global Chief Data Office’s Automated Metadata Generation Project to classify metadata ofpetabytesof
data in IBM’s enterprise data lake. The project’s estimated potential revenue is in the millions of dollars
◦Primary responsibilities involved data-preprocessing, creating and testing classification algorithms, and developing an
Ensemble model in Python
◦Built an ensemble of Deep Learning Classifier, Fuzzy Match Classifier, and Watson NLC Classifier to achieve a precision
value of 0.
◦Built a pipeline to collect and pre-process data as well as fit the classification model which resulted in a 0.75 precision value
◦Created amicro-service, defining dependencies to deploy the classifier/pipeline on Kubernetes
◦Created a pipeline representing all IBM’s metadata entities within a master data management ontology. This pipeline takes
as input entities (schema, tables, columns, statuses, categories, and data terms), their relationships, and an ontology
template and it outputs an RDF and blazegraph
```
- Anglo EasternOperations Engineer Jan 2014 - July 2017Hong Kong

```
◦Applied predictive analytics techniques using sensors data to identify areas that need maintenance on a priority basis to
prevent delays, increase efficiency & reduce the downtime
◦Applied decision optimization techniques on the data related to the routes followed by the ships to minimize cost and
propelling time thus optimizing route and supply chain
◦Reduced fuel consumption by optimizing cargo loading plan and ship speed which led to savings of up to $1M annually
